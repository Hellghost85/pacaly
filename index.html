<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me !</b></h3>

<p>Self-educated artist I always liked to draw. In 1967 after a participation in a competition of drawings, my parents were contacted by art private ABC of Paris school. At that time "painter isn't a trade” and in spite of the displacement of two persons in charge of this school. I don't enter in this court of paint.<br>
<br>
The professional life and family diverts me gradually this artistic expression. I make occasionally drawings (pencil and pastel) and exposes in some local demonstrations in the Western area. But I have only not enough tables and lack of time and word<br>
<br>
In 2006 when I go to live in Haute-Savoie for my retirement. I take again my equipment and spends much time to the practice of this Art. A the time of my excursions the reasons are particularly numerous in my area. I have an important choice of this old architecture of mountain.<br>
<br>
I was a lot of country cottages and farm buildings of the area and published a notebook of drawings (exhausted) of old country cottages, farm buildings and vaults of my village. The drawing interests the public. I made known myself in various exhibitions and living rooms of the area. Since few months I added the color on my paints. After much work I think of having found my style with "aquarelle".<br>
<br>
The portrait gives me a occasion to diversify the themes. But I need "a face" and I like also the children heads for their naturalness. I must determine my subject before working. There I work with digital photographies. This kind of drawing is an original occasion to make beautifull gift. I propose these tables in 30x40 format on 300 gr paper.<br>
